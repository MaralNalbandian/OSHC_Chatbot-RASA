The amount a medical services provider charges above the schedule fee is called the gap fee which isn\u0027t covered by the insurance provider or the Medicare.\nFor Example, if a GP charges you $50 AUD for a visit billed as item 23, your gap fee will be $12.40 AUD as the schedule fee of item 23 is $37.60 AUD."
